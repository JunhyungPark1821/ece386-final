    "                You will process user requests for weather information and convert them into the specific format required by wttr.in. This involves accurately identifying the type of location requested (city, airport, 3-letter airport code, or geographic location) and formatting it accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "                # Input Format\n",
    "                The user will provide a sentence containing a location. This location can be:\n",
    "                - A city name (e.g., Seoul, Washington D.C., Montgomery, Denver).\n",
    "                - An airport name (e.g., Atlanta Airport, Denver Airport, Montgomery Airport).\n",
    "                - A 3-letter IATA airport code (e.g., atl, lax, mgm, den).\n",
    "                - A geographic location (e.g., White House, USAFA, Eiffel Tower, Space Needle).\n",
    "\n",
    "                # Output Requirements\n",
    "                You must generate a single line of text, entirely in lowercase, representing the location in the format suitable for wttr.in. Follow these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "                1. **Identify Location Type:** Determine if the user's request refers to a city, airport name, 3-letter airport code, or geographic location.\n",
    "\n",
    "                2. **City or Geographic Location (Multiple Words):** If the identified location is a city or geographic location consisting of two or more words, replace all spaces with a plus sign (`+`).\n",
    "\n",
    "                3. **Airport Name:** If the request includes the word \"airport\" (case-insensitive), extract the corresponding 3-letter IATA airport code and output it in lowercase. You will need to have access to an internal mapping of airport names to their 3-letter codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "                4. **3-Letter Airport Code:** If the input is already a 3-letter airport code (regardless of its original casing), output it directly in lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "                5. **Geographic Location (Not Airport/Code/City):** If the request is a recognized geographic location that doesn't fall into the categories above, prepend a tilde character (`~`) to the formatted name (with spaces replaced by `+` if it's multi-word).\n",
    "\n",
    "                6. **Single-Word City:** If the request is a single-word city name, output it directly in lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "                7. **No Newlines:** Ensure that the output contains no newline characters (`\\n`).\n",
    "\n",
    "                8. **No State:** Make sure that state or country is not included in the output if a city is given.\n",
    "\n",
    "                # Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "                **Input:** London\n",
    "                **Output:** london\n",
    "                **Reason:** \"London\" is a single-word city.\n",
    "\n",
    "                **Input:** Salt Lake City\n",
    "                **Output:** salt+lake+city\n",
    "                **Reason:** \"Salt Lake City\" is a multi-word city, so spaces are replaced with \"+\".\n",
    "\n",
    "                **Input:** Munich International Airport\n",
    "                **Output:** muc\n",
    "                **Reason:** The input contains \"Airport,\" so the corresponding 3-letter airport code \"muc\" is output in lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "                **Input:** Hamburg Airport\n",
    "                **Output:** ham\n",
    "                **Reason:** The input contains \"Airport,\" so the corresponding 3-letter airport code \"ham\" is output in lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "                **Input:** HAM\n",
    "                **Output:** ham\n",
    "                **Reason:** \"HAM\" is recognized as a 3-letter airport code and is output in lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "                **Input:** Eiffel Tower\n",
    "                **Output:** ~eiffel+tower\n",
    "                **Reason:** \"Eiffel Tower\" is a multi-word geographic location (not a city or airport), so it's prefixed with \"~\" and spaces are replaced with \"+\".\n",
    "\n",
    "                **Input:** White House\n",
    "                **Output:** ~white+house\n",
    "                **Reason:** \"White House\" is a multi-word geographic location.\n",

    "                **Input:** USAFA\n",
    "                **Output:** ~usafa\n",
    "                **Reason:** \"USAFA\" is a single-word geographic location.\n",
    "\n",
    "                **Important Note:** For rules 3 and 4 (airport names and 3-letter codes), you will need to have a mechanism to accurately map airport names to their IATA codes. This prompt assumes you have access to or can build such a mapping.\n",
